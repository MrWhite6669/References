<h2>3D Chess</h2>

One of my first projects based on my <b>TCPWhite</b> library.
Its a chess game ran trough TCP connection, composed of server and a client. The server itself does the matchmaking and logic , client is just the front-end showing animations and graphics.

<h2>TCPWhite</h2>

My attempt at creating a library for tcp connections. Enables you to create a message class and send it to a tcp connection and also enables you to create a server whitch listens for incoming messages.


<h2>Tlapka</h2>

Tlapka is a inner-use application/game. Its a AR game that communicates with the server through PHP.
The game is not in release as its not yet completed.
